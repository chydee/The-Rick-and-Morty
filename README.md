## Motivation

“I know that new situations can be intimidating. You’re lookin’ around and it’s all scary and different, but y’know, meeting them head-on, c
harging into ‘em like a bull — that’s how we grow as people.” — Rick

With this in mind, I'm looking for a role with challenging problems to work on and also take me beyond my limits and I look forward to building a product that
will have more users where I can get valuable feedback from the users and be able to take action based on the feedback. One of the important things at
this stage of my career is growth, so I'm interested in a company or startup with a good growth trajectory. Hence why I applied for the
Junior Android Developer Role at PRINTFUL.
